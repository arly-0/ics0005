Write a Java 8 program to solve word puzzles where you have to guess which digit corresponds to which letter to make a given equality valid. 
Each letter must correspond to a different decimal digit, and leading zeros are not allowed in the numbers.

For example, the puzzle SEND+MORE=MONEY has exactly one solution: S=9, E=5, N=6, D=7, M=1, O=0, R=8, Y=2, giving 9567+1085=10652.

Input data from command line (parameter of the main method) contains three words separated by single spaces: first addend, second addend and sum. 
Words consist of uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet; no word is longer than 18 letters. 
Output has to contain the initial text of the puzzle, at least one solution (if there are any solutions) and total number of solutions. 

Take the input words from command line (parameter array of the main method). Use the backtracking technique known from the "8 Queens" puzzle. Output the text of the puzzle, the number of different solutions and at least one solution (in case the puzzle is solvable).
